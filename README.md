# Pinterest for books

I've always wanted a service to share the books I love (a digital bookshelf) but couldn't really find an easy to use one, so I've decided to make it myself.

**Objective**

Allow users to curate and share a list of books they love in a visual way.

**User Stories**

```

I'd like a website to share a list of my favourite books
